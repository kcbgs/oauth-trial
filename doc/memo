**deviceインストール時に出力されたメッセージ**

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:
     
            root to: "home#index"

   3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
      For example:

        <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
        <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

   4. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

        rails g devise:views

  ===============================================================================

  There is a setup that you need to do before you can use doorkeeper.

  Step 1.
  Go to config/initializers/doorkeeper.rb and configure
  resource_owner_authenticator block.

  Step 2.
  Choose the ORM:

  If you want to use ActiveRecord run:

    rails generate doorkeeper:migration

  And run

    rake db:migrate

  Step 3.
  That's it, that's all. Enjoy!
